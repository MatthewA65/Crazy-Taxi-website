								<p>Crazy Taxi is over 20 years old and still is one of the best video game of all time! There has been no sequel since 2002 and it hasn't aged very well. It is still a fun game and new genuration might find it difficut to get into Crazy Taxi cause of dated graphics etc which is one of the reason why I want a sequel and as well it a really good game! Hopefully if they read our article, they hopefully know how to make the best Crazy Taxi game ever!</p>
								
								<h3>Bring The Offspring and Bad Relgion back!</h3>
								<p><i>Yah! Yah! Yah! Yah!</i> SEGA made that mistake before and it outrage Crazy Taxi fans! If you are going to replace the iconic soundtrack, at least have the soundtrack that is better then. Enough draging SEGA now. The sequel will have all Crazy taxi music with addation one just to make it feel more flesh. With sevral more music, it should make it less annoying just listening to same song repeat. As much as we all love 'All I Want', there's so many time we can just hear it. It be a crime to leave out The Offspring and Bad Relgion all together as without them, it doesn't feel right at all. </p>

								<h3>New engine</h3>
								<p>This is a no brainer but we need it. Say goodbye to pop-ins and chunks appear and disappear! With the new engine, this can make the visual more to the today's standards. The visual graphics can be semi-realtic and be sightly deatiled with also post-processor to enchance it with lens and motion blur which could give more that sense of speed arcoss the streets. If done right, this could make it more pleasing for newer gamers. </p>
								<p>With the new engine, hopefully we get more a open-world gameplay without any pop-ins at all which Crazy Taxi has lot of. Speaking of open world...</p>

								<h3>Open world map</h3>
								<p>Crazy Taxi Aracde map was the best map ever, it has diffrent terrain heights which makes the map interesting and it loops around the city. Crazy Taxi 2 was just like a maze which ruin the game. Building was everywhere which just made the design boring and is mostly flat. Map plays the important and if you got the graphics looking amazing and the map is a bland maze like Crazy Taxi 2, the effort put in for everything but the map department is wasted!</p>
								<p>For them to do it right, they need to make the map big enough for them to exlorpe around while had to have few terrain heights to make it sightly interesting. Road layout is also a important role as it should have some passage way which encourage players to exlorpe around the map. What also make Crazy Taxi, Crazy Taxi is the real business in the game like KFC. It be nice to see more businesses in the game whether as both location and maybe on the billborad arcoss the city. Open world map can bring so much to the gameplay like Burnout Paradise which made the game way more interesting with a open world map that like I said, can exlorpe around and adime the view while driving crazy.</p>
								
								<h3>the drivers</h3>
								<p> If I can plan the Crazy Taxi sequel, I would want to have all the taxi driver from Crazy Taxi to Crazy taxi 3 to be in the game with some new one. Not all you can play yet as I think some drivers you should try to unlock by doing certain activies. You will start off with 4 Taxi driver from Crazy Taxi. Alex, B.D Joe, Gena and Gus. </p>
